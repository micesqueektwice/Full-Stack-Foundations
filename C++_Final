Inheretance is example of what type of relationship = Is base class
What type of relationship is composition = Has as
which is base which is derived
class is how to create derived class from base class
public & private class
How to define Base class function inside derived class?
Polymorphism
How protected, private and public inheritence work 
base class public, derived class will be function with 
protected inheritence
how to create and delcare pointers
how to put address = ampersand 
if given certain code, determine the output
  int x = 5;
  int p = 2x;
  cout << * p;
  what is output? 5
dynamic binding and what it's sometimes called
hidden pointer to itself = this
how to generate exceptions put the whole thing in 
all exceptions derived from exception class
recursion
  base case is when you exit the function
  which is general and which is base case
  general case calls the function
  be able to determine what will be the output of the function
link list
  all elements of linked list are called nodes
 every node except the last one has an address of the next node
 simply, double, circular linked list names
 each node contains address of next node
 last node contains address of 0
 
 Look at the homework with salesperson to understand the code, if you are given loop.  Going through each element of list is called traversal
 Basic operation of linked list is making a copy of the linked list
 removed from front added to back
 if given code with several variables of types, step
